# Node wrapper for jQuery Easing plugin

[jQuery Easing plugin](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) is great library by George McGinley Smith.

This project wraps it with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), so it will be easier to use with AMD and Node.
This especially useful for [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/).

To install:

```
npm install jquery-easing
```

Usage:

```js
var jQuery = require("jquery-easing");
```
